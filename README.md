AI interactive community 

What is this Repo?

The Developer community under the MIT license will be an open source developer community that allows the sharing and networking 
of developers within its network, allows developers have access to materials, models and algorithm within the cloud, allow training, 
development and deployment of solutions in the cloud, with a virtual learning field that helps developers access training and AI
toolkit for self-development. 

The program api will house machine and deep learning models assisting its neural network in terms of data suggestion, data validation, 
speech communication, analytic computing, model training, algorithm compute, self-reliance, self-maintain/updates, assessment and much 
more. The program will actively learn outside its pre-trained algorithm and set api, taking trainings from users during user-machine 
interactions in terms of making suggestions through active communications (speech or embedded text) in all the runtime.  

Forums

The forums will be the social collaboration platform on the community that connects developers with each other, by taking in developers 
profile, profiling them based on a trained api and attaching them with other developers based on their profile for better collaboration.
With access to a live question and feedback session initiated that involves human and machine interactions such that questions asked 
can be answered by a fellow developer or the trained machine (the goal is to allow the machine be part of the conversation and as such 
learns and make better predictions). The session authorizes developers to communicate with others through a video or audio api by 
initiating the commands.

Based on the info-sharing protocol that revolves around the forum, developers have access to an online portal that allows the 
documentation of ideas or contributions into an online book or blog that can be published on the forums to be downloaded as materials or 
read online as a blog. The api for publication will be a trained machine learning user-friendly environment such that authorizes 
various script and language documentation. Developers within the forum can makes searches on such online publications from the 
database.

The forum will host within the portal a quick hire system that hires developers based on an online gig and pays when job gets delivered,
the gig are random jobs specification posted by clients for a service to be rendered, the trained api connects developer to the gig. 
Other gigs hosted within the system are remote jobs from organizations. All contributions (questions, answers, feedback and collaborations)
within the forum are hosted on a database that re-evaluates itself every 12hours by filtering spam and not-spam contributions.

Project Runtime 

The runtime will be developed to allow developers build, train, host, collaborate and deploy projects with their team from the various 
virtual machines, Integrated Development Learning Environment IDLE and engines on the cloud. It supports team creation with a modal 
function that is either randomly chosen by team head or runtime, the modal function arranges team members within the group, sets the 
connections within team members with an open broadcast channel that requires clearance for different level of communications. 
All engines within the runtime can be initiated for a live coding interface (as one developer codes, all active members can see it 
and contribute), the runtime also allows developers to have a live video and audio interactions from the open broadcast channel 
between themselves.

Within the runtime are various trained api that suggests suitable models for specific problems, interact with teams via speech, 
search for research materials related to project from the virtual library, suggests useful collaborations to team members and 
much more. Developers can initiate instances from the CPU or GPU engine which can be used to train their models faster, 
they can preview a demo version of their project in the Garage, make repairs, and recreate with tools available before deploying 
project.

A virtual library will be hosted on the runtime with authorization to a large resource files on data, algorithms, models and 
research materials from top data companies. Each of these information will be captured on our server as 2D but returned on search in 3D, 
such that all searches can be viewed in the virtual environment, here developers can store, view, send, copy and delete such files with
no restrictions. Comments and documentations from the community forum will be rerouted in searches from the backend development.

The hosted CPU or GPU engine on the cloud allows for easy training, building and deployment of project. Models available on the runtime 
can be initialized by teams in building projects, domain name for websites can be bought, wordpress account can be initialized with 
runtime for coding process, other languages IDLE can be initialized in the virtual machine for coding, teams can link up other 
community accounts and with their runtime for code execution. Developers will have access to sharing live code in the terminal 
using the THROW and EXCHANGE api and can switch IDLE comfortably.
Various AI Toolkit and IDLE for the different engines will be installed on the virtual machines, allowing developers to access them 
by creating instances which in turns launch the virtual machines from the CPU or GPU processor integrated into the cloud runtime. Each 
virtual machine launched will be hosted on the local server with an open-end and closed-end channel rerouted from the backend development.

Teams can access instance files stored in project terminal during online and offline collaboration, the runtime allows the creation of 
README.md files by host developer, guest developers joining the project will require clearance to modify such files, but can add new 
README.md files and other files in the project terminal, all other subsequent documentation and code snippet can be modified by guest 
developers. During live coding, runtime automatically updates scripts and codes in the project terminal. Teams of one project can 
collaborate with teams of a different project, with access to their documentation and repository files, communication channels are also 
open for team members of the different teams to communicate and share documentation.

Teams can initiate project in the community for UI/UX development, web hosting, web development, machine learning, web application,
wordpress development, software development (andriod, windows, linux, ios), data minning, analytics, game tech and much more with 
secured collaborations of host and guest teams.


Virtual Learn

The learn environment will be hosted on the community to activate virtual learning for non-developers and developers expanding their
knowledge in the field of technology. It will contain virtual frameworks of various programming languages integrated from the backend 
that allows users to pick a code snippet from the UI/UX which in turns transform the code into blocks. These blocks constitutes part of
models structure used to train a developer in the learning environment (as a developer picks a code, he gets to see the 3D functionality 
of that code with its application). 

The environment also will house a neural network of data that feeds its neurons during trainings. No form of video learning/tutorials 
will be recorded here, as the virtual learn will host a voice assistant that interacts with users during training making trainings 
interactive. Users can also use the training runtime hosted on the simulation environment to build minor projects based on the parameters and model
available on the runtime. These runtimes will be integrated with a trained api that assists users during development in terms of 
suggestion, selection, classification, communication and others.
